This location is for project-specific nuke Gizmos and nuke Toolsets. Any .gizmo
or .nk files placed in this folder will be added to the project tools menu
within nuke. You may want to organize your gizmos into folders to keep the root
of the menu from getting over-crowded.

You can version your files like 'filename_v1' and only the latest version will
be added to the menu while past version will remain valid for backwards
compatibility.
